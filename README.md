## Usage
This app empowers you to plan, track, and crush your fitness goals with personalized training programs.

üöÄ How It Works
* Log in to your personal space.
* Choose two key variables for your(s) program(s):
         * **Frequency**: How many days per week you want to train.
         * **Duration**: Your short-term goal timeline (e.g., 4 weeks to boost stamina or build strength).
         * Set your start date, and the app automatically calculates your end date.

üî• Your Custom Program
* The app generates a tailored workout plan based on your preferences. Each session is designed to target all major muscle groups.

üìä Track & Conquer
* Log the weights you lift for every exercise, marking them as completed. Once all exercises are done, the session is automatically checked as completed. Once all sesions are done, the program is automatically checked as completed.

üìà See Your Progress
* Real-time stats: Sessions completed, remaining, and overall progress.
* Visualize your gains: A sleek graph tracks your weight-lifting history for every exercise, so you can see your progress over time.
